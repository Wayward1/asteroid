A realm of asteroids and comets is created in the chosen volume, by default between y = 13000 and y = 14000.
Asteroids are very rich in ironore, and rich in mese blocks, copper, gold and diamond.
Comets are made of waterice and snow and are surrounded by a misty atmosphere of water vapour which hides the nucleus from view.
Both have weblike 'fissure' cave systems.
Asteroid stone can be crafted to dark stone bricks or slabs.
By crafting, stone can be broken down into cobble, cobble into gravel and gravel into dust.
Comet ice and snow can be crafted to default:water_source.
Generation time per chunk can be up to a minute on my old slow laptop, progress is printed to the terminal.
Generation can be disabled without disabling the entire mod and it's nodes (parameter ONGEN = false).
